Hello, world. The [[lab-react]] rewrite is done!

I've written the first project and deployed the new app, and it, well, it works! I like the new workflow with the obsidian integration, but there are still a few missing pieces:
- I don't have an automated system that would take notes with the publish tag and move them into a specific directory
- I'd like a few more images in the lessons
- I've tested the first project with Google Translate... It. Is. HORRIBLE! In the lesson where I explain what a microcontroller is, it translated MCU as Marvel Cinematic Universe! It repeats the same phrases over and over and never uses synonyms.

I have more time now that I had in the last few months, so I can work on fixing those and writing new projects concurrently.

I'll post here when I have updates. See you!
