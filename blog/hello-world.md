Hello world. Sorry I haven't made any commits for almost 3 weeks now even though I promised that [[lab]] will get weekly updates. I've been busy with the uni so all my side projects had to be put on hold. Now I'm ready to restart a few of them. Here's what I'm about to do:

## Changes

- I'll be revisiting [[sld]] on 2025-06-14 and publishing [a roadmap](/notes/sld-roadmap.md)
- [[lab]] will receive an update on Monday the 9th and then return to weekly
- [[sld]] will be down for a few hours closer to the end of the month because I really need to reimage the server
- I'll be publishing all the progress and roadmaps for my projects going forward
- I'm focusing on finishing things instead of getting them perfect

This page is a perfect example of the last point. I wanted to make a homepage and a mirror of my notes for quite a while now, but I never had time for it. Now I have this. It's bad, it's just markdown. Definitely needs improvement. But this place now *exists*, and I can publish the progress *somewhere*. That's the important part.

Expect the next post around Monday. See you then!
