The options I've considered for that are:
- write everything in English and then rewrite in Russian
- write everything in English and make built-in browser translators behave correctly
- write everything in English and then use an LLM fine-tuned for translation to speed up the process

The second can be achieved with a `translate="no"` attribute. Will have to test to see if it's reasonable to use that.

The last one is basically a no-compromise option, but it'd take a bit of time.
