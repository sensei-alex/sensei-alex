## What is this project?
It's a relay that turns on and off at specific times.

## Where can I use it?
Automated lighting or watering systems for plants.

## What will I learn?
- what a microcontroller board is
- how to make it talk to a computer
- how to put programs on the microcontroller board
- what a library is
- how to make the code do things in the real world
- what a while loop is
- what a relay is and how to use one

## What do I need?
This is the first batch of hardware, it will be used in the next few projects, not just this one.
- 1 `ESP32 C3 SuperMini`
- 6 *6x6x5mm buttons* (they often come in packs of 10)
- 1 *dual relay module*
- 1 `mosfet` *module*
- 1 *10K potentiometer*
