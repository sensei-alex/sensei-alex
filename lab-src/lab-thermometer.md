## What is this project?
This is a simple temperature sensor that connects to a computer via USB.

## Where can I use it?
Can be used in later projects to know if the electronics is overheating or not.

## What will I learn?
- what a microcontroller board is
- how to make it talk to a computer
- how to make it do things in the real world
- what a library is
- and what a while loop is

## What do I need?
This is the first batch of hardware, it will be used in the next few projects, not just this one.
- 1 `wemos s2 mini` (the purple one, *not* the blue `d1 mini`)
- 6 *6x6x5mm buttons* (they often come in packs of 10, that's ok)
- 1 *dual relay module*
- 1 `mosfet` *module*
- 1 *10K potentiometer*
